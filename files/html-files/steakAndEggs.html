        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p class="flex-item directions">
            <ol>
                <div class="subDirections">Roast Asparagus</div>
                <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Rinse asparagus and pat dry.
                    Trim about 1/2-inch
                    from the stalky ends then discard. Place onto the baking sheet. Toss with olive oil then lightly
                    season with salt and
                    fresh ground black pepper. Spread into a single layer. Bake until tender, 12 to 20 minutes depending
                    on the thickness of
                    your asparagus.</li>
                <br>

                <div class="subDirections">Cook Steak</div>
                <li>Heat a heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pan over medium-high heat (we love using our cast iron pan). Season
                    steaks with salt, a
                    generous amount of pepper and the dried thyme. Use your fingers to rub the seasoning and about 1
                    teaspoon of olive oil
                    onto both sides of the steaks. Add steaks to the preheated pan and cook 1-2 minutes on each side
                    then slide into the
                    oven and cook 2-3 minutes for medium to medium-well. Remove from oven and rest 5 minutes before
                    slicing into thin
                    strips.</li>
                <br>

                <div class="subDirections">To Finish</div>
                <li>While the steak rests, fry the eggs. Heat a frying pan over medium heat, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt
                    and a tablespoon of
                    olive oil. Wait 20 seconds then add eggs, one by one, to the pan. While the eggs cook, use a spoon
                    to drizzle the hot
                    olive oil over the whites of each egg. Cook until the egg whites are firm, but the yolk is still
                    runny.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Serve by placing sliced steak next to the roasted asparagus, and then top with an egg and parmesan
                    shavings.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
