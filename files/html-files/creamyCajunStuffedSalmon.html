        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p class="directions">
            <ol>
                <div class="subDirections">Combine</div>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine spinach, cream cheese, cheddar, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning,
                    and 1/4-teaspoon salt. Fold in crab meat.</li>
                <br>

                <div class="subDirections">Slice and Dice</div>
                <li>Using a paring knife, slice a slit in each salmon fillet to create a pocket; season salmon all over
                    with
                    remaining 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning and 3/4-teaspoon salt. Stuff pockets with spinach mixture.
                </li>
                <br>

                <div class="subDirections">Heat It Up</div>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add salmon flat side up and cook, flipping
                    halfway through,
                    until salmon easily flakes with a fork and is just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Add
                    lemon juice and
                    butter to skillet and tilt skillet to combine.</li>
                <br>

                <div class="subDirections">Finish and Serve</div>
                <li>Using a thin spatula, transfer salmon to plates. Serve warm with lemon wedges alongside.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <p class="myThoughtsParagraph">If one's goal is to try and lose weight, I can see where this dish may turn some people off
            (the cream cheese, the butter,
            and salmon, while high in protein, is rather dense in calories). But for the athletes out there who stay
            super active or are trying to gain size,
            this meal is laden with protein, fats, and calories to give your body the fuel it needs to perform.
