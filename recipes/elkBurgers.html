            <div class="subDirections">Roast Asparagus</div>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Rinse asparagus and pat dry. Trim about 1/2-inch
            from the stalky ends then discard. Place onto the baking sheet. Toss with olive oil then lightly season with salt and
            fresh ground black pepper. Spread into a single layer. Bake until tender, 12 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of
            your asparagus.</li>
            <br>
            

            <div class="subDirections">Cook Steak</div>
            <li>Heat a heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pan over medium-high heat (we love using our cast iron pan). Season steaks with salt, a
            generous amount of pepper and the dried thyme. Use your fingers to rub the seasoning and about 1 teaspoon of olive oil
            onto both sides of the steaks. Add steaks to the preheated pan and cook 1-2 minutes on each side then slide into the
            oven and cook 2-3 minutes for medium to medium-well. Remove from oven and rest 5 minutes before slicing into thin
            strips.</li>
            <br>

            <div class="subDirections">To Finish</div>
            <li>While the steak rests, fry the eggs. Heat a frying pan over medium heat, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of
            olive oil. Wait 20 seconds then add eggs, one by one, to the pan. While the eggs cook, use a spoon to drizzle the hot
            olive oil over the whites of each egg. Cook until the egg whites are firm, but the yolk is still runny.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Serve by placing sliced steak next to the roasted asparagus, and then top with an egg and parmesan shavings.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="thoughtsP">Truth be told, I do not have anything to add to this meal. It is a very light, clean, healthy meal. An absolute protein powerhouse!</p>
