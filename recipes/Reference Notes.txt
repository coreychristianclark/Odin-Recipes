Notes:

4/2/23 {

1. Add a hover effect to all images. Sightly darken, and have text show up over the picture. *Perhaps change cursor on hover too*
2. Add my own personal take on each recipe (things you can change to make it healthier, etc.).
3. Remove the recipe text at the top of the page, and provide a covert way of navigating.
4. Find a subtle way to give credit to the actual recipe page.
5. Maybe create windowed partitions so the ingredients and instructions can be next to each other.
6. Make images on home page bigger.
