    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>

    <p>     I feel rather confident that we as a human species can find common ground in one area in particular -- 
        a love for delicious food. As an athlete, I look to consume not only delicious food, but healthy, protein-packed 
        food. What goes into our body will have effects on our body -- good or bad.

            With this page, it is my goal to share with you some of my favorite healthy meals. I will note, though,
        that these recipes are not bulletproof, so I'll add my take on what can be done to a given dish to offer you 
        some healthier alternatives.
