# Odin Recipes Desktop
First Odin Project Assignment


Welcome to my site!

This is my first non-hand-held project I've done since learning how to code some months back -- courtesy of The Odin Project.

The goal of this project was to pick 3 recipes of your choosing and create a webpage displaying them. The design and layout are all my doing. I wanted to put these recipes on a cleaner interface (typical recipe pages are cluttered with ads and popups), as well as add my own thoughts to the recipes.

I've included the original source for each recipe at the bottom of each HTML file.

For any questions, suggestions, or to report errors, please [contact me!](mailto:coreychristianclark@gmail.com)
